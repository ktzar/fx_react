Simple example of a currency exchange single-page application using:
- Redux
- Sagas
- React
- Styled components

The application consists of a number of "pockets" where you have certain amount in different currencies, and a system with which you can move amounts between currencies in such pockets.
The initial amounts are hardcoded in src/redux/pockets.js

In order to run it you should execute:

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```
